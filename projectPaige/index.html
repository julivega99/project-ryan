                  Greeting Paige. Lets take a journey. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  To my very best friend in the whole wide world, to the bestest friend there 
                  ever was, happy birthday. Almost five years ago, you walked into Ms. Yao‚Äôs physics 
                  400 class, sat down next to me, and my life has never been the same. From bonding 
                  over She‚Äôs The Man (I still have your candy grams you sent me signed Duke Orsena), 
                  to convincing me to take Russian, to all of our Sunday night commons dinners (when 
                  I got ice cream AND milk, i love milk more ‚Äúthan any other animal by product), you 
                  have been the best friend I could have asked for, and a far better friend than I 
                  deserve. You put up with me freaking out over my inability to understand calc, you 
                  got me through Nana‚Äôs death, and my last basketball game ever. I love you more than 
                  you know, and I am so proud to call you my best friend. You are full of grace and 
                  poise, of love and laughter. You are intelligent and kind when people deserve it, 
                  and sassy when they don‚Äôt. You are loved by so many people, BUT NONE MORE THAN ME. 
                  I am so proud of you. I am so thankful for you. I am thankful for you calling me and 
                  yelling MERHHHH. For our den dates where we would eat ice cream and judge people. For 
                  our many trips to Asheville (ASHEVILLE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME) and Quichi and most 
                  importantly my favorite place in the world, Wayland. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Word cannot express how much I love you, and how in awe I am that this beautiful, 
                  intelligent, charismatic lady let me be her best friend, but all I can do is say 
                  thank you for loving me, and putting up with my craziness. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Love you love you 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  MERHHHHHH
