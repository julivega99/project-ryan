                  Greeting Paige. Lets take a journey. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  To my very best friend in the whole wide world, to the bestest friend there 
                  ever was, happy birthday. Almost five years ago, you walked into Ms. Yao‚Äôs physics 
                  400 class, sat down next to me, and my life has never been the same. From bonding 
                  over She‚Äôs The Man (I still have your candy grams you sent me signed Duke Orsena), 
                  to convincing me to take Russian, to all of our Sunday night commons dinners (when 
                  I got ice cream AND milk, i love milk more ‚Äúthan any other animal by product), you 
                  have been the best friend I could have asked for, and a far better friend than I 
                  deserve. You put up with me freaking out over my inability to understand calc, you 
                  got me through Nana‚Äôs death, and my last basketball game ever. I love you more than 
                  you know, and I am so proud to call you my best friend. You are full of grace and 
                  poise, of love and laughter. You are intelligent and kind when people deserve it, 
                  and sassy when they don‚Äôt. You are loved by so many people, BUT NONE MORE THAN ME. 
                  I am so proud of you. I am so thankful for you. I am thankful for you calling me and 
                  yelling MERHHHH. For our den dates where we would eat ice cream and judge people. For 
                  our many trips to Asheville (ASHEVILLE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME) and Quichi and most 
                  importantly my favorite place in the world, Wayland. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Word cannot express how much I love you, and how in awe I am that this beautiful, 
                  intelligent, charismatic lady let me be her best friend, but all I can do is say 
                  thank you for loving me, and putting up with my craziness. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Love you love you 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  MERHHHHHH

                  Hi Paige this is Michael from April 24th. Not to confuse you with Michael of now.
                  Ahhh time what a beautiful thing it is. I have and do appreciate u very much as a 
                  friend Paige and geting to see you grow into a full blown college educated woman
                  has been beautiful. I am so glad to have been freinds with you all of college.
                  You have the voice of an angel. I am wishing you the biggest 21st homie. Plase pop
                  off so hard with Shelby

                  My dearest Piaget! Happy 21 my dear!!! I love you oh so much and thinking about 
                  how lucky I am to have had you throughout my entire college experience makes me 
                  EMOTIONAL. We‚Äôve traveled the world together, lived together, car ride sang 
                  together, eaten a RIDICULOUS amount of Trader Joe‚Äôs cornbread crisps together, 
                  and damn no one can make me laugh like you, crazy gal. I‚Äôm inspired by your 
                  warmth and openness‚Äîit is so rare to find someone who would drop anything when 
                  the people they care about are down and it comes to naturally to you. After 
                  growing together the past few years (through shitty men, veryyyy drunk nights, 
                  movies and snuggles in your bed, so many laughs) I can‚Äôt wait to do forever with 
                  ya. Even though I probably can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm the Charno who is most obsessed 
                  with you (Asher has that title) I love you forever to our sweet Teele home and 
                  back!

                  Dearest Piaget, 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Happy 21st birthday! I am so grateful that fate took over freshman year and we ended up in the same TWO group. 
                  I would like to think that we would have eventually found each other had we not met in pre-o but regardless, 
                  we would have lost even more time not knowing each other had that happened. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I cherish you every day because you are loyal and steadfast. 
                  You inspire me because you have grit and love a challenge. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Life takes so many twists and turns, it‚Äôs nice to know that I‚Äôll always have you along for the ride. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Whether it‚Äôs organizing a friend‚Äôs birthday, inviting friends over to your house when they need a 
                  break from school, making people feel included, or a million other things - you always put people first. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I love and appreciate you for all that you are. A huge thank you to Shelby and Tom for creating and shaping 
                  you - they did such a wonderful job üôÇ 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I‚Äôm going to keep you around forever :))

                  Dear Paige,
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I believe in timming, I believe that the people who are meant to come into your life
                  will at the right moment, and that is what happened with you. Mamma mia joined us a year ago
                  and from the moment I met you, something made me trust you blindly and open up to you.
                  Nevertheless, today, I do not know what my life would be without sing-alongs, thursday nights,
                  trader joe's food, spontaneous facetimes, badass jams, sporadic gym adventures, shoe confussions,
                  pants sharing, sleepovers and, above all, YOU. Thank GOD I came to your house that september afternoon; 
                  thank you universe dearest russian fuckboy was an asshole; thank you universe Henry broke my 
                  heart. If one of those things changed, I would not have you in my life, and that is something
                  I trully cannot bear. Sometimes very bad things have to fall appart in order for something else
                  to come together with wine, McFlurry's and snacks.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  You are my bestfriend and my soulmate. You are the person whose house I would walk in 
                  the rain to in order to spend one night at the pub with. You are the sister I found in
                  college, and that is something I have never said to anyone.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Paige, you are an inspiration, the strongest woman I know, the most badass bitch I look up to,
                  and the person who I would go on a trip with in a heartbeat. Thank you for your unconditional
                  love and support, for putting up with me talking about shitty boys, and for all the salmon and 
                  thursday nights. I love you so much that if you married Harry Styles I would not be jealous.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Here is to more thursdays, more pubs, more wholesome conversations, more sharing
                  the same pant size and sharing jeans, and more... just more... 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Te amo guapa
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Now, lets talk about your bday gift.
                  <br>
                  I. It is from madhappy bc you make me MADHAPPY
                  <br>
                  II. I hope everytime you wear it, you feel my love because no matter where on 
                  <br>
                  III. EARTH I am, I will always be here for you. And the EARTH without you 
                  would be unbearable.

                  It's funny that the more time you spend with someone, the more difficult it becomes to describe what 
                  spending time with them feels like, and what it means to you to know them. To say "I love you" is 
                  tweely depicted as the three most important words one person can say to another, but for how I feel about 
                  you that just doesn't quite cut it. Yes, I love you. But I also adore you. I admire you. And I feel that 
                  I'm a better person, living a happier life, because I know you. Happy Birthday ‚ù§Ô∏è"

                      My dearest, darling Paige, 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      To think I have known you for just (shy of) four years is extraordinary 
                      to me - it feels like a decade.¬†¬†When I met you in the Steinbach Lobby 
                      for UTB auditions on my 18th birthday, there was something about you that 
                      struck me and drew me in.¬†¬†You laughed uproariously when I started 
                      impersonating a stage manager for Mariah Carey and I was relieved someone 
                      found it funny.¬†¬†It gave me hope that I would have a chance at being a part 
                      of something at Andover after appearing out of nowhere, knowing nobody.
                      <br>
                      <br>         
                      It‚Äôs hard to put into words, but when I first met you, I felt so markedly 
                      transplanted and so out of place like I didn‚Äôt belong.¬†¬†Similar to what 
                      we are experiencing now, my life seemed paused.¬†¬†However, I was ready to 
                      slip in where I could so that I could open myself up; I wanted people to 
                      know me and I wanted to know them.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      It‚Äôs hazy, but I think you walked out with me after our first Sunday morning 
                      UTB practice.¬†¬†I rarely did actual homework during the daylight so I assume 
                      we probably went to the Den chatting.¬†¬†In our early conversations, it was 
                      apparent that you were smarter than anyone I had met at GDS (or ever) but 
                      you weren‚Äôt pretentious.¬†¬†You were/are refreshingly witty and humble and I 
                      wanted to learn more about your life and your interests.¬†¬†Most of all, you 
                      listened, carefully, to what I had to say and it made me feel so valued at a 
                      time of great loneliness and aimlessness.
                      <br>
                      <br>¬†
                      At GDS, I was overwhelmed at the thought of eating with someone else during 
                      lunch and not once did I have someone over to my house on the weekend.¬†¬†At 
                      Andover, all I wanted to do was hang out with you: meals, after school, on 
                      the weekends, during the weird part of the afternoon where nothing was happening, 
                      WEDNESDAY MUNCH‚Ä¶ you were/are my home base and your personality and charm sucked 
                      me in.¬†¬†Thank god Berto was already graduated because you would have been 
                      locked away having some parietal in Paul.¬†¬†(I was so threatened when he came 
                      back for A/E but I was also excited to meet him lmao)¬†
                      <br>
                      <br>¬†
                      Fall 2016 feels like a lifetime ago but you have been a constant.¬†¬†
                      Thank you for being the person I trust most (wink) and for constantly 
                      getting me to better myself.¬†¬†I really don‚Äôt know what I add to your 
                      life but thanks for tolerating me because I‚Äôm here. to. stay.¬†¬†You are a 
                      beautiful, brilliant, bold, badass bitch and my life is better with you 
                      in it.
                      <br>
                      <br>
